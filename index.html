        <h2>What we do?</h2>

        <p>
        <h3>Empirical research on Effective Altruism</strong></h3>
        <ul>We lead the work on the Effective Altruism Survey and the Local Groups Survey alongside the <a target=_blank href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a></ul>
        <ul>Together with <a target=_blank href="https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, we turn our data into key analyses on the shape and direction of Effective Altruism</ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Tools to do the most good with</h3>
        <ul>We have released the <a href="www.eahub.org" target="_blank">EA Hub</a>, aiming to enable and inspire collaboration within the EA movement by making it easier for people to network, and work together on promising initiatives.</ul>
        <ul>It delivers, among other features, <a href="resources.eahub.org" target="_blank">actionable advice and guidance</a> based on empirical analysis and <a href="https://eahub.org/profiles/" target="_blank">a map of the global EA community</a> along with individual and group profiles.<br /> Next in queue is the projects feature, allowing users to share what they're working on.</ul>
